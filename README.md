# RAG-Documents-Q-A-Using-NVIDIA
This project is a high-performance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that allows users to chat with their documents (PDFs) in real-time. By leveraging Nvidia’s NIM inference microservices, the application provides ultra-low latency responses using state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and optimized embedding models.
